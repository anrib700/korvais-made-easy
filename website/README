This is the our setup of maintaining Korvai.org's website.

Generating the website
----------------------

Run the script: ./scripts/generate-website.py

All files will be created in the content directory. We can have subdirectories
inside the content directory. All files should end with '.txt' extension.
Running the script ./scripts/generate-website.py will create HTML files in
/home/htdocs directory. One HTML file will be created for each TXT file in
content. The directory structure of the content directory will be replicated in
the /home/htdocs directory as well.

The HTML files will be created only if an entry is made for that TXT file
content/config.py.

Automatic mp3 audio links
-------------------------
I have written a markdown extension (scripts/markdown-1.6/mdx_mp3inline.py)
which automatically converts links of the form {{link}} into an inline MP3
audio player link. For this reason, we have to use the python version of
markdown scripts/markdown-1.6.

Images
------
All images will be stored on flickr.com. We will be using the account
haran34579. We will link to the images on the flickr server from here.

Music files
-----------
We expect to have a lot of audio/mp3 files. It is cheaper to host such
files on Amazon S3.

The domain name korvai.org
--------------------------
Our domain name korvai.org is registered with namecheap.com.

namecheap.com's DNS servers handle the domain name and IP address. They just
point to nearlyfreespeech.net's servers. This is the current configuration.

     www.haran34579.korvai.org  CNAME          korvai.org
     files.korvai.org           CNAME          s3.amazonaws.com

E-mail addresses
----------------
namecheap.com also handles our email and forwarding. The current configuration is:

     comments@korvai.org      is also forwarded to      suriya@alumni.cs.utexas.edu
