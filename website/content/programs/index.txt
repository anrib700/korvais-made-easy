## Thaniaavarthanam Programmes

Mridanga Thaniaavarthanam, the heart of Carnatic music percussion, is a delight
to all rasikas and laya rasikas in particular. We have been presenting this
intriguing aspect of Carnatic music, with distinction, for the past four years
in succession.  Each year we presented a unique theme through a series of
pre-selected Thalams in all five Nadais.  Each year we have been fortunate to
receive the encouragement and support of stalwarts and young musicians in the
field of Carnatic music, and Rasikas as well. We thank everyone for their
support.
