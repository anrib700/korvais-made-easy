Our second Thaniavarthanam programme was held on the 27th of July, 2004 at
Bharathiya Vidya Bhavan (Main Hall), Mylapore. This programme also marked the
release of the book __Korvais Made Easy__ by M N Hariharan.  The book provides
an easy way to compose Korvais for any Thalam, Nadai and Eduppu of a
composition.  The book has been reviewed by several leading musicians, and
forewords are by Guru Kaaraikkudi Mani, Madurai Shri T Srinivasan, Shri T R
Subramanyam, Mannargudi Shri A Easwaran, Padma Shri Haridwaramangalam Shri A K
Palanivel, Mambalam Shri M K S Siva and Mambalam Shri M K S Natarajan.  The
forewords in english are available at our [website][forewords].  __Guru
Kaaraikkudi Mani__ released the book, and __Madurai Shri T Srinivasan__
received the first copy. The [speech by Guru Kaaraikkudi Mani][speech]
{{speech}} included a Korvai in Adhi Thalam, composed using the book, in the
Nadais Chatusram (4), Tisra Mel Kalam (6), and Chatusra Mel Kalam (8), for an
Eduppu of 4 Mathirai ([mp3][korvai] {{korvai}}).

The book release function was preceded by our second Thaniavarthanam, this time
in Adhi Thalam. We performed all the five Nadais this year as well. A
distinguishing feature of this programme was the fact that the Pallavis were
sung in the same Nadais as the Thaniavarthanam.  The Pallavis extolling the
Nadais themselves were composed by Shri T A P Ravishankar. The programme also
featured a demonstration of the book [Korvais Made Easy][demo] {{demo}}. A
[review][] of the programme appeared in The Hindu.

In addition to all the musicians who wrote the forewords, senior musicians
including Chinglepet Shri Ranganathan, Sangitha Kalanidhi Dr N Ramani, Prof. S
R Janakiraman, Shri V S Narasimhan, Smt. Vasanthalakshmi Narasimhachari and
Shri M V Narasimhachari, a lot of other young musicians, and journalists
attended the programme.
