We presented our first Thaniavarthanam programme at Vani Mahal Mini Hall

five Eka Thalams. We presented Tisra Mel Kalam Nadai (6
letters each count) in Tisra Eka Thalam (3 counts), Chatusra
Mel Kalam Nadai (8) in Chatusra Eka Thalam (4), Kanda
Nadai (5) in Kanda Eka Thalam (5), Misra Nadai (7) in
Misra Eka Thalam (7), and finally, Sankirna Nadai (9) in
Sankirna Eka Thalam (9).  Pallavis were composed on various
deities by Shri T A P Ravishankar. 

Please listen to the concluding piece of the programme, in Sankirna Eda Thalam.
