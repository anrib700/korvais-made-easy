## Third Mridanga Thaniaavarthanam Programme, 2005

We presented our Third Mridanga Thaniaavarthanam Programme on the 5th of August
2005 at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mylapore, Chennai. The Thaniavarthanam was
played in a unique Thaalam, *Bhinna Gaatha Bhinna Gamana Aadhi Thaalam*. The
performers were students of M N Hariharan; Suriya Subramanian and T Sampath.
Master M Balamuralikrishna provided the vocal support rendering pallavis
composed by Kumbakonnam Shri A K Gajendran. Laya Legends Sanngeetha Kalanidhi
Dr. T K Murthy and Padmashri Haridwaramangalam Shri A K Palanivel were chief
guests of the evening.

## Bhinna Gaatha Bhinna Gamana Aadhi Thaalam

Bhinna means variation in sanskrit. Gaatha is the beat and Gamanam refers to
the Nadais. We varied the counts (beats) of the popular Aadhi Thaalam and also
the Nadais and got five different Thaalams.

As we all know, Aadhi thaalam is composed of three angams namely Chatusra Laghu
(First four counts), Dritham (5th and 6th counts) and Dritham (7th and 8th
counts). The first beat of every angam is varied in an orderly fashion to
obtain the five thaalams. The names of the five different thalaams are 

* Chatusra Ghaata Aadhi Thaalam (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 counts)
* Thrishra Ghaata Aadhi Thaalam (1&#189; + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1&#189; + 1 + 1&#189; + 1 = 9&#189; counts)
* Dwikalai Chatusra Ghaata Aadhi Thaalam (2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 11 counts)
* Kanda Ghaata Aadhi Thaalam (2&#189; + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2&#189; + 1 + 2&#189; + 1 = 12&#189; counts)
* Trikalai Ghaata Aadhi Thaalam (3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 14 counts)

In these Chatusra Ghaata Aadhi Thaalam is the same as the usual Aadhi thalaam.
It has 8 counts. Thrisra Ghaata Aadhi Thaalam is a variation of Chatusra Ghaata
Aadhi Thaalam, in that, the first, fifth and the seventh counts are increased
by a half a count. Similarly, for Dwikalai Chartusra Ghaata Aadhi Thaalam, half
count is increased in the first, fifth and seventh counts of Thrisra Ghaata
Aadhi Thaalam. The other thaalams are obtained in the same manner. The basic
idea is to increase the number of counts by half for every successive thaalam.

For each of the five thaalams, we presented a pallavi  sung by Master M
Balamuralikrshna. Also we chose 4 edams (places) in all the pallavis and played
korvais in different nadais. We used our book "Korvais Made Easy", to get the
answers (alavu) for these korvais. all the korvais would start at the
samam (starting point of a thalaam) and ends at the appropriate places.
