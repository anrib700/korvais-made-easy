## Welcome to Korvai.org

Welcome to Korvai.org. Thank you for visiting out website.  This is a project
to disseminate information about Layam to music lovers all over the world.
Though the focus is on Mridangam, we would like to encourage all Carnatic
musicians to use this resource.  The goal of this project is to take the
concept of rhythm to the masses and make them appreciate it.

For students of Layam, we have made our [compositions][] available. We are in
the process of converting all our lessons to PDF format.  These lessons follow
our notation scheme ([PDF][notation-PDF]) ([HTML][notation-HTML]). We have
composed several varieties for Kuraippus. We will try to make them available
soon.

We sincerely request you to send us your [suggestions, comments, and
questions][contact].  We look forward to your feedback. Thank you.
